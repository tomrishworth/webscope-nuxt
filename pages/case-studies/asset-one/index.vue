      <h2>The initial workshop</h2>
      <p>
        To kick off the project we took our client through a guided workshop that uses a variety of design thinking tools which allowed us to get a good understanding of the project, and develop some useful strategy. The real benefit of the workshop is that it provides a structured, creative environment that quickly uncovers the most effective solution with the best return on investment. We call this the
        <strong>minimum viable product (MVP)</strong>.
